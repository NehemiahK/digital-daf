                "And one who grinds: Rav Pappa said: One who Parim silka on Shabbos is liable [for transgressing the melachah of] grinding.  Rabbenu Chananel Z\"L explained this as palm fronds that stand as lines, like strings. When you extract these strings a fine-flour like substance comes out of them. Therefore, for separating them he liable for Grinding.  This is a proper explanation similar to Salis Silta [wood shavings]. However, that which Rashi explained this \"Parim Silta\" as cutting vegetables very fine, is a dumbfounding explanation.  A food item that he cuts very very fine cannot be subject to [the prohibition] Grinding.   "
