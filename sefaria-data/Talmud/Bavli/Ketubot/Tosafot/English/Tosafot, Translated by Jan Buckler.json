                "<b>MISHNA: a virgin.</b> Sometimes the Mishna refers to a subject with the <b>ה' הידיעה,</b> which is the equivalent of ‘the’ or ‘that’, and refers to a known subject. Sometimes as in our Mishna, the Mishna does not use that <b>ה'</b>. Tosfos explains why this is so: <b>The reason that</b> the Mishna <b>does not say ‘the’ </b>b’soloh<b> as it says ‘the’ woman is acquired, </b>and<b> ‘the’ </b>y’vomoh<b> is acquired (Kidushin 2a), because there </b>in Kidushin the Mishna<b> is referring </b>to the woman mentioned <b>in the verse (D’vorim 22, 13): when a man will acquire a woman. </b>The Mishna there is speaking of <b>that woman </b>about whom the verse<b> is written. And so too ‘the y’vomoh </b>is referring to that Y’vomoh mentioned in the verse in D’vorim 25, 7. <br><b> However, here</b> in our Mishna the term b’suloh <b>is not referring</b> to a b’suloh that is mentioned in <b>any verse. </b>According to this explanation when the Mishna in Kidushin 14b speaks about a Jewish slave it should say ‘the’ Jewish slave, because it is speaking of the slave mentioned in a verse, but it does not. This needs to be explained.<br><b> And the reason that the Mishna in the first Perek of Kidushin does not say ‘the’ Jewish slave, even though </b>it is referring to a slave that<b> is mentioned in a verse (Sh’mos 21, 2): if you will purchase a Jewish slave, </b>that is <b> because if so,</b> that the Mishna would insist on using the ה', <b>it would need to say העבד העברי – the Jewish slave, </b>using a ה' twice, for עבד and for עברי, <b>because the word עברי is not attached to <span dir=\"rtl\">עבד</span>.</b><sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The phrase does not mean the slave of a Jew. It means a slave who is a Jew. The correct expression when employing the ה' הידיעה, is העבד העברי.</i> The term does not mean the slave of a Jew; if that was the case it could say עבד העברי. However, the meaning of the phrase is the slave who is a Jew. The correct grammar for this phrase is העבד העברי, <b>and it is not usual for the Talmud to speak this way. </b>The Mishna prefers to drop the ה' it would ordinarily use when referring to a character mentioned in the Torah, in favor of maintaining its style of writing.<br> Tosfos acknowledges that there are many times in the Mishna where the <b>ה'</b> is used even though the specific character is not mentioned in a verse.<b> However, in regard to a man and a woman it is the norm in all places to mention </b>these words<b> with a ה', even though </b>the specific event discussed <b>is not referring to a </b>man or woman mentioned in a <b>verse. Such as: ‘The’ woman who went </b>with her husband to a foreign land (Y’vomos 114b),<b> ‘The’ woman who was widowed (below 16b),</b> and <b>‘The’ man may impose a vow upon his son to be a</b> nozir<b> (Nozir 28b). </b>In all these Mishnayos the Mishna speaks of ‘the’ man and ‘the’ woman, even though there is no specific verse that speaks of these stories.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maharam Schiff explains that Tosfos means that since man and woman are mentioned with the ה' in Kidushin 2a, 41a, because the Mishna there is referring to a verse, whenever they are mentioned elsewhere the Mishna uses the ה', even though that specific Mishna is not referring to a verse.</i>\n"
